    <p>Port 22: South Sound Hackers (SSH) is a community of hackers, makers,  and artists in the greater 
        Tacoma area seeking to create an inclusive physical Hackerspace to serve the local community. We are passionate 
        about learning, creating, and sharing knowledge and our mission is to promote and encourage technical, 
         scientific, and artistic skills through individual projects, collaboration, and education. 
        Our goal of having a physical location would allow us to serve our community through  
         access to space, resources, classes and workshops and opportunities for networking in Tacoma area. We hope 
        you'll bring your unique interests and skills and join us!</p>
